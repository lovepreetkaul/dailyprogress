# DailyProgress

Simple ruby gem to convert my vimwiki diary entry to daily progress email.

## Dependency

Vimwiki should be installed and generate the diary entry in the following format:

```text
1. [] First Item
2. [] Second Item
3. [] Third Item
```

The gem requires the vimwiki location to be configured.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'DailyProgress'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install DailyProgress

## Usage


Call the Gem executable with the path argument

    $ ruby DailyProgress /path/to/vimwiki

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

## Roadmap

Further, need to add the functionality to copy the result content into the clipboard. Currently the output is to STDOUT.
